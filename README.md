# Ember Code

**One spark ignites a team.** An AI coding assistant built with [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) orchestration.

```
 ◆ ignite-ember — ignite-ember.sh
```

Inspired by [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), Ember Code is a terminal-based coding agent that assembles specialized AI teams on the fly. Describe your task — the Orchestrator picks the right agents, the right team mode, and runs them.

## Why Ember Code?

Claude Code uses a single agent loop — powerful but monolithic. Ember Code takes a different approach: **dynamic multi-agent orchestration**. Instead of one agent doing everything, Agno's team system decomposes tasks, routes them to specialized agents, and synthesizes results — all automatically.

| Feature | Claude Code | Ember Code |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Single agent loop | Multi-agent teams (Agno) |
| Task routing | Manual sub-agent spawning | Automatic via Coordinate/Route modes |
| Code intelligence | Grep + file reads | VectorBridge semantic search (included free) |
| Knowledge base | None | ChromaDB vector store with custom embeddings |
| Planning | Plan mode (read-only) | Agno reasoning + Tasks mode |
| IDE integration | MCP server (stdio) | MCP server + client (Agno MCPTools) |
| Extensibility | Plugins, hooks, MCP | Agents + hooks + toolkits + MCP |
| Agent evals | Not built-in | Built-in regression testing framework |
| Memory | File-based MEMORY.md | Agno Memory + DB-backed storage |
| Learning | None | Agno LearningMachine (user profiles, entity memory) |
| Guardrails | None | PII detection, prompt injection, moderation |
| HITL | Implicit | Explicit confirmation/input requirements |
| Default model | Anthropic Claude | MiniMax M2.5 (model-agnostic, swappable) |

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install ignite-ember
# or: pip install ignite-ember
ignite-ember /login       # sign up / log in for hosted models
ignite-ember
```

Or bring your own model:

```bash
brew install ignite-ember
# or: pip install ignite-ember
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_key   # or OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.
ignite-ember
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ignite-ember/ember-code.git
cd ember-code
pip install -e ".[dev]"
make check               # lint + format + typecheck + test
ignite-ember /login
ignite-ember
```

## TUI Mode

`ignite-ember` launches the Textual-based terminal UI by default — no flag needed. Use `--no-tui` to fall back to plain Rich CLI output.

Features: streaming responses, agent tree visualization, token tracking, session picker, keyboard shortcuts, HITL confirmation dialogs.

## IDE Integration

Ember Code integrates with IDEs via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ignite-ember": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "ignite-ember",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Works with **VS Code**, **JetBrains** (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.), **Cursor**, and **Windsurf**. See [MCP docs](docs/MCP.md) for details.

## Key Features

### Knowledge Base

Built-in vector knowledge base powered by ChromaDB and the Ember embeddings API:

```yaml
knowledge:
  enabled: true
  collection_name: "my_project"
  embedder: "ember"            # uses Ember server's /v1/embeddings
```

Add content via slash commands: `/knowledge add <url|path|text>`, search with `/knowledge search <query>`. Agents can search the knowledge base automatically during execution.

### Learning & Reasoning

- **Learning** — Agno LearningMachine builds user profiles, entity memory, and session context across conversations
- **Reasoning tools** — `think` and `analyze` tools for step-by-step reasoning during complex tasks

### Guardrails

Built-in safety guardrails via Agno's pre-hook system:

```yaml
guardrails:
  pii_detection: true          # detect and flag PII in prompts
  prompt_injection: true       # detect injection attempts
  moderation: true             # OpenAI moderation API
```

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Agents can pause execution to request confirmation or user input before proceeding with sensitive operations. The TUI shows interactive approval dialogs.
