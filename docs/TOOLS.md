# Tools

Ember Code leverages Agno's toolkit system to give agents capabilities. Each agent gets only the tools it needs — no more.

## Core Toolkits

Ember Code uses the **same tool names as Claude Code**. Each name maps to an Agno toolkit under the hood:

| Tool Name | Agno Toolkit | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Read` | `FileTools(read_only=True)` | Read file contents |
| `Write` | `FileTools()` | Create/overwrite files |
| `Edit` | `EmberEditTools` (custom) | Targeted string-replacement editing |
| `Bash` | `ShellTools` | Shell command execution |
| `Grep` | `GrepTools` (custom) | Regex content search (ripgrep) |
| `Glob` | `GlobTools` (custom) | File pattern matching |
| `LS` | `ShellTools(commands=["ls"])` | List directory contents |
| `WebSearch` | `DuckDuckGoTools` or `TavilyTools` | Web search |
| `WebFetch` | `WebTools` (custom) | Fetch and extract URL content |
| `Orchestrate` | `OrchestrateTools` (custom) | Spawn sub-teams from agent pool |
| `VectorBridge` | `VectorBridgeTools` (custom) | Semantic search over pre-processed code intelligence |
| `Python` | `PythonTools` | Execute Python code |

---

## VectorBridge — Semantic Code Intelligence

VectorBridge is the most important tool in Ember Code's arsenal. While other tools operate on raw text (grep for patterns, read for contents), VectorBridge provides **pre-processed, semantic understanding** of the entire codebase.

### What It Does

VectorBridge pre-analyzes every entity in the codebase (files, classes, functions, modules, packages) and generates rich summaries across **multiple categories**:

| Category | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| **Code** | Purpose, behavior, algorithm, data flow |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, auth patterns, input validation, secrets handling |
| **Testability** | Test coverage, mockability, edge cases, testing patterns |
| **Architecture** | Dependencies, coupling, design patterns, module boundaries |
| **Performance** | Bottlenecks, complexity, resource usage, optimization opportunities |
| **Maintainability** | Code quality, readability, tech debt, documentation |

### Hierarchical Summaries

Summaries are built **bottom-up**: children are summarized first, then their summaries are fed into the parent's summary generation. This means:

```
function summary  →  feeds into  →  class summary
class summary     →  feeds into  →  file summary
file summary      →  feeds into  →  module/package summary
module summary    →  feeds into  →  project summary
```

A module-level summary doesn't just describe the module — it already contains condensed knowledge about every function and class inside it. This gives the AI **multi-resolution understanding**: zoom out for architecture, zoom in for implementation details.

### Semantic Search

Instead of keyword matching, VectorBridge finds code by **meaning**:

```python
from ember_code.tools.vectorbridge import VectorBridgeTools

vb = VectorBridgeTools(
    api_url=config.vectorbridge.api_url,
    api_key=config.vectorbridge.api_key,
    project_id=config.project_id,
)
```

**Functions:**
- `search(query, categories?, entity_types?, limit?)` — semantic search across summaries
- `get_entity(path)` — get full summary for a specific entity (file, class, function)
- `get_children(path)` — get summaries of all children of an entity
- `get_references(path)` — get entities that reference or are referenced by a given entity
- `get_category(path, category)` — get a specific category summary (e.g., security analysis of a file)

### Why This Matters

Traditional code search is syntactic — `grep "authenticate"` finds the string, not the concept. VectorBridge is semantic:

| Query | Grep | VectorBridge |
|---|---|---|
| "how does auth work?" | Finds files with "auth" in the name/content | Returns the auth module summary with flow description, security analysis, and references to all related files |
| "what's vulnerable?" | Can't answer this | Returns security-category summaries flagging issues across the codebase |
| "where should I add rate limiting?" | Can't answer this | Returns architecture summaries of request-handling modules with dependency analysis |
| "what needs more tests?" | Can't answer this | Returns testability-category summaries ranking under-tested areas |

### Example: Search Results

```
> search("authentication flow", categories=["code", "security"])

Results:
1. src/auth/middleware.py (score: 0.94)
   Code: "JWT-based authentication middleware. Validates tokens from
         the Authorization header, checks expiry and signature against
         the JWKS endpoint, and populates request.user. Falls back to
         session cookies for browser clients."
   Security: "Token validation is solid but refresh token rotation is
             not implemented — stolen refresh tokens have unlimited
             lifetime. The JWKS cache has no TTL, which could delay
             key rotation propagation."
   References: → src/auth/jwt.py, src/auth/sessions.py, src/api/deps.py

2. src/auth/jwt.py (score: 0.91)
   Code: "JWT token creation and validation. Uses RS256 with keys from
         the JWKS endpoint. Token payload includes user_id, roles, and
         expiry. Helper functions for extracting claims."
   Security: "RS256 is appropriate. However, the 'none' algorithm is
             not explicitly rejected in the validation function —
             verify this is handled by the JWT library."
   References: → src/auth/middleware.py, src/config/security.py
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# .ember/config.yaml
vectorbridge:
  enabled: true
  api_url: "https://api.vectorbridge.io"
  # api_key is read from VECTORBRIDGE_API_KEY env var
  categories:                          # Categories to index
    - code
    - security
    - testability
    - architecture
    - performance
    - maintainability
  auto_refresh: true                   # Re-index on significant changes
  refresh_on_git_push: true            # Trigger re-index after push
```

### Fallback: Local Mode

If VectorBridge cloud is unavailable, Ember Code falls back to local tools (Grep, Glob, Read). The experience degrades gracefully — agents still work, just without semantic understanding. The Orchestrator is aware of VectorBridge availability and adjusts its team plans accordingly (e.g., adding more Explorer agents to compensate with broader file reads).

---

## File Operations

### Read / Write (FileTools)

Read and write files on the local filesystem.

```python
from agno.tools.file import FileTools

# Read-only mode for Explorer/Reviewer
FileTools(read_only=True, base_dir="/path/to/project")

# Full access for Editor
FileTools(base_dir="/path/to/project")
```

**Functions:** `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_files`

### Edit (EmberEditTools)

Targeted string-replacement editing (inspired by Claude Code's Edit tool). Instead of rewriting entire files, it replaces specific text spans — producing minimal, reviewable diffs.

```python
from ember_code.tools.edit import EmberEditTools

# Performs old_string → new_string replacement
edit_tools = EmberEditTools(base_dir="/path/to/project")
```

**Functions:**
- `edit_file(path, old_string, new_string)` — replace a specific string in a file
- `edit_file_replace_all(path, old_string, new_string)` — replace all occurrences
- `create_file(path, content)` — create a new file (fails if exists)

**Why custom?** Agno's built-in `FileTools.write_file` overwrites the entire file. For coding, targeted edits are safer — they produce smaller diffs, reduce merge conflicts, and are easier to review.

---

## Search

### Grep (GrepTools)

Content search using ripgrep (`rg`), providing fast regex search across the codebase.

```python
from ember_code.tools.search import GrepTools

grep_tools = GrepTools(base_dir="/path/to/project")
```

**Functions:**
- `grep(pattern, path?, glob?, type?)` — search file contents with regex
- `grep_files(pattern, path?)` — return only matching file paths
- `grep_count(pattern, path?)` — return match counts per file

### Glob (GlobTools)

File pattern matching for finding files by name/path.

```python
from ember_code.tools.search import GlobTools

glob_tools = GlobTools(base_dir="/path/to/project")
```

**Functions:**
- `glob(pattern, path?)` — find files matching a glob pattern (e.g., `**/*.py`)

---

## Shell Execution

### Bash (ShellTools)

Execute shell commands with configurable restrictions.

```python
from agno.tools.shell import ShellTools

# Unrestricted (Editor Agent)
ShellTools(base_dir="/path/to/project")

# Restricted to specific commands (Explorer Agent)
ShellTools(
    base_dir="/path/to/project",
    commands=["rg", "find", "tree", "wc", "cat", "head", "tail"],
)
```

**Functions:** `run_shell_command(command, timeout?)`

**Safety:** Commands are validated before execution. See [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for sandboxing options.

---

## Web Access

### WebSearch (DuckDuckGoTools)

Web search without API keys.

```python
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

web_search = DuckDuckGoTools()
```

**Functions:** `duckduckgo_search(query)`, `duckduckgo_news(query)`

### WebFetch (WebTools)

Fetch and extract content from URLs.

```python
from ember_code.tools.web import WebTools

web_tools = WebTools()
```

**Functions:**
- `fetch_url(url)` — fetch URL content, extract text
- `fetch_json(url)` — fetch and parse JSON

---

## Python Execution

### Python (PythonTools)

Execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.

```python
from agno.tools.python import PythonTools

python_tools = PythonTools(
    base_dir="/path/to/project",
    pip_install=True,  # allow installing packages
)
```

**Functions:** `run_python_code(code)`, `pip_install(package)`, `read_file(path)`, `list_files(path)`

---

## Git & GitHub

Git operations are handled via `ShellTools` with git/gh commands. The Git Agent wraps these with safety checks:

- **Pre-push confirmation** — always asks before pushing
- **Force-push protection** — warns and requires explicit confirmation
- **Destructive operation guards** — `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D` require approval

---

## Knowledge Base

### Knowledge (KnowledgeManager)

Built-in vector knowledge base powered by ChromaDB and the Ember embeddings API. Unlike VectorBridge (which provides pre-processed semantic code intelligence), the Knowledge system is a general-purpose document store that users can populate with any content.

```yaml
knowledge:
  enabled: true
  collection_name: "my_project"
  embedder: "ember"            # uses Ember server's /v1/embeddings (384-dim)
```

**Slash commands:**
- `/knowledge` — show knowledge base status (document count, collection info)
- `/knowledge add <url|path|text>` — add content to the knowledge base
- `/knowledge search <query>` — search the knowledge base

**How it works:**
1. `EmberEmbedder` calls the Ember server's `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (proxying to text2vec-transformers, 384 dimensions)
2. Documents are chunked and stored in ChromaDB with vector embeddings
3. Agents can search the knowledge base automatically during execution via Agno's `Knowledge` integration

**Data models (Pydantic):** `KnowledgeAddResult`, `KnowledgeSearchResponse`, `KnowledgeFilter`, `KnowledgeStatus`

**Requires:** `pip install ember-code[knowledge]` (installs `chromadb`)

---

## Orchestration

### Orchestrate (OrchestrateTools)

Enables agents to spawn sub-teams at runtime. Any agent with `can_orchestrate: true` (the default) gets access to this tool.

```python
from ember_code.tools.orchestrate import OrchestrateTools

orchestrate = OrchestrateTools(pool=agent_pool, config=settings)
```

**Functions:**
- `spawn_team(task, agent_names?, mode?)` — spawn a sub-team to handle a task. The Orchestrator picks agents and mode if not specified.
- `spawn_agent(task, agent_name)` — spawn a single agent for a focused sub-task.

**Depth limits:** Configurable via `orchestration.max_nesting_depth` (default: 5) and `orchestration.max_total_agents` (default: 20). See [Security](SECURITY.md) for details.

---

## Custom Tools

You can add custom tools using Agno's `@tool` decorator:

```python
from agno.tools import tool

@tool(description="Run the project's test suite")
def run_tests(test_path: str = "") -> str:
    """Run tests, optionally filtering by path."""
    import subprocess
    cmd = ["pytest", "-v"]
    if test_path:
        cmd.append(test_path)
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, cwd=project_dir)
    return result.stdout + result.stderr
```

Place custom tools in `~/.ember/tools/` or `.ember/tools/` for project-level tools. They're automatically discovered and available to agents.

## Tool Access by Built-in Agent

Each built-in agent's tools are declared in its `.md` file. This table shows the defaults:

| Tool | Explorer | Architect | Planner | Editor | Simplifier | Reviewer | Security | QA | Debugger | Git | Conversational |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Read` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | - |
| `Write` | - | - | - | yes | - | - | - | yes | - | - | - |
| `Edit` | - | - | - | yes | yes | - | - | yes | yes | - | - |
| `Grep` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | - |
| `Glob` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | - |
| `Bash` | - | - | - | yes | yes | - | - | yes | yes | yes | - |
| `LS` | yes | yes | yes | - | - | yes | yes | - | - | - | - |
| `WebSearch` | yes | yes | yes | - | - | yes | yes | - | - | - | - |
| `WebFetch` | yes | - | - | - | - | yes | - | - | - | - | - |
| `Orchestrate` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | - |

Since agents are `.md` files, you can change any agent's tools by editing its definition or overriding it in `.ember/agents/`.
