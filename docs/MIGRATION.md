# Coming from Claude Code

Already using Claude Code? Ember Code is designed to feel familiar while giving you more. Agent definitions, MCP configs, and hooks use the **same formats** — most things just work when you switch.

## What Just Works (Zero Migration)

| What | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Agent `.md` files | `.claude/agents/` | Loaded when `cross_tool_support: true` |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/` | Loaded when `cross_tool_support: true` |
| MCP config | `.mcp.json` | Same format, same location, works as-is |
| Hooks | `.claude/settings.json` | Same event names, same JSON format, same exit codes |
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | Ember Code reads `CLAUDE.md` in addition to `ember.md` |

Enable cross-tool support to scan Claude Code directories:

```yaml
# .ember/config.yaml
agents:
  cross_tool_support: true
skills:
  cross_tool_support: true
```

Or copy your agents/skills into `.ember/agents/` and `.ember/skills/` — no conversion needed since the file format is the same.

---

## Quick Start (for Claude Code users)

```bash
brew install ignite-ember
# or: pip install ignite-ember
ignite-ember /login                   # sign up at ignite-ember.sh
ignite-ember                         # start — enable cross_tool_support to pick up existing agents
```

To use your existing Claude Code agents and skills immediately, add to `.ember/config.yaml`:
```yaml
agents:
  cross_tool_support: true
skills:
  cross_tool_support: true
```

---

## What's Different

### 1. Dynamic Teams Instead of Manual Sub-Agents

**Claude Code:** You spawn sub-agents manually. The parent agent decides when to delegate. Sub-agents can't spawn their own sub-agents (depth limit: 1).

**Ember Code:** An Orchestrator meta-agent automatically assembles teams for each task. It picks agents, chooses the team mode (route, coordinate, broadcast, tasks), and runs them. Every agent can spawn sub-teams — no depth limit.

```
Claude Code:                       Ember Code:
  You → Agent → Sub-agent            You → Orchestrator → Team
                                            (auto-assembled)
                                         ├─ Agent A
                                         ├─ Agent B → Sub-team
                                         └─ Agent C    ├─ Agent D
                                                       └─ Agent E
```

You don't need to tell Ember Code which agents to use. Just describe the task.

### 2. Team Modes

Claude Code has one execution model: single agent loop with optional sub-agent spawning.

Ember Code has four team modes, picked automatically per-task:

| Mode | What It Does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Route** | Pick one agent, pass through | "What does this function do?" → Explorer |
| **Coordinate** | Sequential multi-agent | "Add endpoint with tests" → Planner → Editor → Reviewer |
| **Broadcast** | Parallel independent agents | "Review for security + performance" → both run simultaneously |
| **Tasks** | Autonomous multi-step | "Migrate test suite" → iterates through files |

### 3. Agents as Extensible Data

Both use `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. Ember Code adds **optional** extension fields:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Does things
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
model: MiniMax-M2.5        # (Claude Code uses: claude-sonnet-4-6)

# Ember extensions (ignored by Claude Code)
tags: [backend, api]
reasoning: true
can_orchestrate: true       # can this agent spawn sub-teams?
---
```

Claude Code agents work in Ember Code. Ember Code agents work in Claude Code (extensions are ignored).

### 4. VectorBridge (Semantic Code Intelligence)

Claude Code agents grep for patterns. Ember Code agents can also search by **meaning** via VectorBridge:

```
"How does authentication work?"
  Claude Code: grep for "auth", read matching files
  Ember Code:  VectorBridge returns pre-processed summary with
               security analysis, dependency graph, and references
```

See [VectorBridge](VECTORBRIDGE.md) for details.

### 5. Default Model

Claude Code defaults to Anthropic models (Claude). Ember Code defaults to **MiniMax M2.5** through the Ember Code hosted endpoint, but supports any model:

```yaml
# Use any OpenAI-compatible model
models:
  custom:
    - name: "claude-sonnet"
      url: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
      api_key_env: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
      model_id: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

|---|---|---|
| `"allow": ["Bash(npm run *)"]` | `permissions.shell_restricted: "allow"` | Ember uses category-based + patterns |
| `"deny": ["Read(.env)"]` | `safety.protected_paths: [".env"]` | Ember uses a dedicated protected paths list |
| `"ask": ["Bash(git push *)"]` | `safety.require_confirmation: ["git push"]` | Same concept, different syntax |

### Memory & Storage

| Claude Code | Ember Code | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/projects/<id>/memory/` | Agno Memory (DB-backed) | Ember uses Agno's memory system |
| File-based `MEMORY.md` | `~/.ember/memory.db` (SQLite) | Structured storage, not files |
| Local sessions only | SQLite default, remote backends available | Configure `storage.backend: "postgres"` to sync |

## Migration Checklist

### Minimal (just switch)

- [ ] `brew install ignite-ember` (or `pip install ignite-ember`)
- [ ] `ignite-ember /login` (sign up at ignite-ember.sh)
- [ ] Run `ignite-ember` — it automatically picks up:
  - `.claude/agents/*.md` (your agents)
  - `.mcp.json` (your MCP servers)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (your project instructions)

### Recommended (get the full benefit)

- [ ] Copy `CLAUDE.md` → `ember.md` (or keep both — Ember reads both)
- [ ] Add Ember extensions to agents that benefit from them:
  - `tags` for better Orchestrator routing
  - `reasoning: true` for agents that need chain-of-thought
  - `can_orchestrate: false` for agents that shouldn't spawn sub-teams
- [ ] Copy hooks from `.claude/settings.json` → `.ember/settings.json`
- [ ] Run `/onboard` to set up VectorBridge indexing
- [ ] Run `/propose-agents` to get project-specific agent suggestions
- [ ] Run `/evals run` to verify agents work correctly

### Optional (power features)

- [ ] Set up a remote storage backend for cross-device sync
- [ ] Configure BYOM if you want to use specific models
- [ ] Create project-specific evals for your custom agents
- [ ] Add VectorBridge-aware search to your agents' system prompts

## Side-by-Side: Same Task, Different Approach

**Task:** "Add rate limiting to the /api/users endpoint with Redis and tests"

**Claude Code:**
```
You → Claude (single agent)
  1. Claude reads existing code (Read, Grep)
  2. Claude writes implementation (Edit, Write)
  3. Claude writes tests (Edit, Write)
  4. Claude runs tests (Bash)
  5. All in one agent loop, one context window
```

**Ember Code:**
```
You → Orchestrator
  → Assembles team: [planner, editor, reviewer] in coordinate mode

  1. Planner reads code, designs approach (Read, Grep, VectorBridge)
  2. Editor implements rate limiting (Read, Edit, Write, Bash)
     └─ Editor spawns Explorer sub-team to understand Redis patterns
  3. Editor writes tests (Read, Edit, Write)
  4. Reviewer validates implementation (Read, Grep, VectorBridge)
     └─ Checks security category for rate limiting best practices
  5. Editor runs tests (Bash)
```

Same result. Ember Code's approach gives better results on complex tasks because:
- Each agent has a focused role and system prompt
- VectorBridge provides architectural context that raw code search misses
- The Reviewer catches issues the Editor might overlook
- Sub-teams provide help exactly when needed
