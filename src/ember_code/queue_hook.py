"""Queue-aware tool hook — injects queued user messages between agent steps.

Agno fires ``tool_hooks`` around every tool call. This hook checks the
message queue after each tool execution and, if new messages are waiting,
pops them and sets ``agent.additional_input`` so the agent sees them on
its next model call (alongside the tool result it just produced).

Flow:
1. Tool call N starts → clear any previously injected messages
2. Tool call N executes via ``func`` (the next function in the hook chain)
3. After execution → pop queued messages, set ``agent.additional_input``
4. Model call N+1 sees: [tool_result_N, user: "[User sent: ...]"]
5. Agent incorporates the new context into its next reasoning step

        Optional callback ``() -> None`` called after the queue is mutated
        so the UI can refresh the panel.

        This is intentionally a **sync** function. Agno's sync tool execution
        path filters out ``async def`` hooks via ``iscoroutinefunction`` and
        skips them entirely — their coroutine repr then leaks into tool
        results as ``<coroutine object ...>``. Keeping this sync ensures it
        runs in both sync and async execution paths.

        In Agno's sync path, ``func`` is always sync. In the async path,
        Agno's wrapper awaits whatever this hook returns, so returning a
        coroutine from an async ``func`` is fine.

        NOTE: The parameter MUST be named ``func`` (not ``next_func`` etc.)
        because Agno's ``_build_hook_args`` only recognises specific names:
        ``func``, ``function``, ``function_call``, ``name``, ``args``, etc.
